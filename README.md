## Err4 Module
It is an error pointer in HTTP or HTTPS server. It aims to catch an error in a server or code or use it as an error command. (Most things may be missing as it is under development.)

**Note:** Since the full version is not active at the moment, you may experience errors while using it. But we are doing our best to release stable to Full version. This open source project is open to contributions. For this reason, you can add any contribution. (Further versions will be published in the following days.)
